# A/B Testing: Frequentist vs Bayesian Approaches

This project demonstrates statistical A/B testing methodology using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Through a real-world e-commerce dataset, it compares how different statistical frameworks can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of a new webpage design on conversion rates.

## What You'll Learn

- How to properly design and set up an A/B test experiment
- Data cleaning techniques for removing contaminated experimental data
- Frequentist hypothesis testing using chi-square tests and p-values
- Bayesian inference using Beta distributions and posterior probabilities
- How to interpret and communicate statistical results for decision-making

# Task Translation: Applied LLMs for Business Cases

## Activity: Scoping a Data / ML Problem Using LLMs

### Overview: What is this task?
You are a Product Manager working with a Data Science / ML team. Your job is to take a vague idea from leadership (like "let's use AI") and turn it into a clear plan. You are not building the model; you are defining the project scope before any technical work starts.

This includes:
* **Clarifying the problem:** What are we actually trying to solve?
* **Identifying methods:** Finding the right type of ML approach (even if it's new to you).
* **Defining the scope:** Deciding which data to use and what the model should do.

### Important Constraints
* **No Labeled Data:** Assume there is no clean, labeled training data at the start.
* **Discovery First:** You may need to find patterns in the data before making predictions.
* **Data Types:** You might work with text, images, audio, logs, or time series.
* **Justification:** You must explain why you chose a specific method and why others (like supervised learning) might not work yet.

### What are the Deliverables?
For your chosen tasks, you must create a "Scoping Document" with these sections:

#### 1. Problem Clarification
* What is the real problem?
* Who is the end user or decision-maker?
* What action will be taken based on this system?
* **Output:** A short problem statement in simple english (2–3 sentences).

#### 2. Problem Type Classification
* Choose the framing: (e.g., Supervised, Unsupervised, Time-series, Recommendation, etc.).
* **Output:** The problem type and a short reason why it fits.

#### 3. Data Science Scope
* Describe the data: Type (text, images, etc.), level of detail (user-level, event-level), and if labels exist.
* Identify risks: (e.g., bias, data quality, or missing information).

#### 4. Modeling Approach (High-Level)
* Suggest 1–3 model types.
* Explain why they fit and why other methods would NOT work.
* (No math or code needed here).

#### 5. Use of LLMs (Reflection)
* How did you use the LLM?
* Give one example of how it helped you.
* Give one example where you had to correct or refine the LLM's answer.

#### 6. Unknown Methods Discovery
* Mention at least one technique you didn't know before.
* Explain why it is relevant and what it means in your own words.
* Describe one mistake or wrong assumption you had that was corrected.
